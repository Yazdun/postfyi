# Next.js Version 13 + Tailwind CSS

Boilerplate code for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky).

Created this repository as a template to create new projects without installing the supporting packages (tailwindCSS, Prettier etc.)
